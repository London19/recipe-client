## Kids' Recipe

Welcome to my Kids' Recipe Sigle Page application created with JavaScript and jQuery, Ruby and Rail. This is my second single page application built in General Assembly Software Engineering immersive. My README will show you my story, challenges while I was creating this apllication.

## Technology Used for Front-End
•	HTML •	CSS •	JavaScript •	JQuery •	AJAX •	JSON •	Bootstrap •	API
• Handlebar

## Planning:
I started to plan my project by drawing out the framework and writing user stories. Once I had the framwork done. And I carefully read through the instruction and the requirement of building the application.

## Development Process:
I start with fornt-end by working in HTML. After I have the layout of the header, sign-up, sign-in, change-password, sign-out, get recipe, create and change recipe buttons, I started to work in my JavaScript to give this buttons some functions. Since I should be able to take data from my back-end I started to built up my api then. I also use handlebar so that I could be able to make my recipe to show on my screen.

## Problem Solving:
My challenge was how to actuclly put my json on the screen. I stuck on that for long time, becasue I didn't realized that I could use handlebar to do that.

## Framwork and User Story:
